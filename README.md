# Memory Allocator (Buddy System)

In this problem, my partner and I built a memory allocator. It implements the functions my_malloc() and my_free(), much like the standard C malloc() and free().  

The [Buddy System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddy_memory_allocation) works by partitioning memory into halves in an attempt to find the best fit.  

We used an implementation of the Ackermann Function to test our code.
